# Spark IMDb Analysis ‚Äì Set 4
Big Data project using Apache Spark (RDD + DataFrame API) to process IMDb data and identify top movie participants by profession.

## Project Description

This notebook implements a Big Data processing task using Apache Spark. The goal is to analyze IMDb datasets and determine which individuals participated in the most movies for the most common professions.

The **main objective** is to find the **top three individuals** in terms of movie participation for each of the **four most common professions** found in the data. Only movies with a **fully credited cast** are included, defined as those with:
- at least one actor or actress (role in `actor`, `actress`, `self`)
- at least one director (`role = director`)
- at least two additional people with any role

Two separate implementations are included:
- **Part 1** ‚Äì Using the low-level **RDD API**
- **Part 2** ‚Äì Using the higher-level **Spark SQL / DataFrame API**

The results of both parts are consistent and demonstrate different approaches to solving the same task.

## Technologies Used

- Apache Spark (tested in local mode with Docker and on Dataproc cluster)
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Docker

## How to Run Locally

1. Build and run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker build -t spark-local .
   docker run -p 8888:8888 -v %cd%:/home/jovyan/work spark-local
   ```

   Or on Windows, run the included script:
   ```
   run_spark_container_windows.bat
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook in your browser at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) and run `spark-imdb-analysis-set4.ipynb`.

3. The notebook runs Spark in **local mode** and does not require a remote cluster.

### Dataset Descriptions

#### `datasource1` ‚Äì title.crew.tsv
This dataset contains detailed information about the people credited in individual movies. Each row describes a person‚Äôs involvement in a specific title (film), with role metadata.

- Format: Tab-separated values (TSV), **no header**
- Sample fields:
  - `tconst` ‚Äì unique identifier for a title (movie)
  - `ordering` ‚Äì order of appearance in the credits
  - `nconst` ‚Äì unique identifier for a person
  - `role` ‚Äì general category of the person's role (e.g., actor, director)
  - `job` ‚Äì specific job title (e.g., writer, cinematographer)
  - `characters` ‚Äì names of characters portrayed (if applicable)

This dataset allows us to determine each person's function in the creation of a movie and evaluate whether a title meets the definition of a "fully credited cast".

#### `datasource4` ‚Äì name.basics.tsv
This dataset contains biographical and professional information about people in the film industry.

- Format: Tab-separated values (TSV), **with header**
- Sample fields:
  - `nconst` ‚Äì unique identifier for a person
  - `primaryName` ‚Äì full name of the person
  - `birthYear` ‚Äì year of birth
  - `deathYear` ‚Äì year of death (\N if unknown)
  - `primaryProfession` ‚Äì comma-separated list of professions (e.g., actor, director)
  - `knownForTitles` ‚Äì list of title IDs associated with the person

We use this dataset to determine a person's profession(s), life span, and popularity metrics (based on the number of people in each profession).
